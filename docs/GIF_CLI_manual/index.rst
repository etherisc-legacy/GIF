    Once developed by the Etherisc team, the Generic Insurance Framework (GIF) is released as an environment where product builders can create their own products. To access the GIF and to make user experience more enjoyable, the Etherisc team has also created a so-called "sandbox" — a particular working environment where product builders are able to experiment with their products in a test mode, not worrying about possible "unexpected" results.

    The next step is to equip product builders with a plain and powerful solution, enabling them to operate the GIF, as well as a sandbox for it. Such a solution is now available for product builders through the GIF Command Line Interface (CLI). Here, we present a quick reference on how to use the Command Line Interface while working with the GIF.

    For better understanding of this document, you can refer to the `User manual for the GIF <https://gif-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`_ to refresh the content and the features of the framework. There you can also find basic methods necessary for creating your own product's contract.
